# Fitbit Watch Faces

This is just a collection of Fitbit watch faces designed for my Versa 2. Most of these projects are for discovery purposes, so take it for what you will.

## Installation

### On WSL/Linux

Fitbit depends on [`node-keytar`](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar), and you need to follow special installation instructions to add `libsecret` to your system. Installation information can be found [here](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar#on-linux).
